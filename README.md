## üîß Usage

### Option 1: Download and Run

```bash
# Download the script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ubuntu-server-setup/main/ubuntu_update.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x ubuntu_update.sh

# Run the script
sudo ./ubuntu_update.sh
```

### Option 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ubuntu-server-setup.git

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Zsh Setup**: The script installs Zsh and Oh My Zsh first, making it the default shell. All configurations are added to `.zshrc` only.

2. **SSH Security**: The script configures UFW to allow SSH connections before enabling the firewall to prevent lockout.

3. **Fail2Ban Configuration**: A custom Fail2Ban configuration is created to protect against brute force attacks on SSH and Nginx.

4. **Shell Change**: You'll need to log out and log back in for the shell change to Zsh to take effect.

5. **Development Tools**: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui CLI are installed globally, so you can use them in any project with the `tailwindcss` and `shadcn-ui` commands.

6. **Rust Tools**: The script installs `bat` (a better `cat` replacement) and `lsd` (a modern `ls` alternative) with convenient aliases configured in Zsh.

## üîç What the Script Does

1. **Installs Zsh & Oh My Zsh**: Sets up the Zsh shell environment first

2. **Updates System**: Runs `apt update` and `apt upgrade`

3. **Configures SSH**: Installs and secures the SSH server

4. **Sets Up Firewall**: Configures UFW with SSH protection

5. **Installs Nginx**: Sets up a web server with a custom welcome page

6. **Configures Fail2Ban**: Protects against brute force attacks

7. **Installs Rust and Tools**: Sets up Rust via rustup and installs bat and lsd

8. **Installs Python Tools**: Sets up Python, pip, and uv package installer

9. **Installs Node.js Tools**: Sets up Node.js, PM2, pnpm, and global frontend tools

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can customize the script by editing it before running:

```bash
# Open the script in Vim
vim ubuntu_update.sh

# Or with nano

```
