### üåê Web Server
- Nginx web server with a custom welcome page
- HTTP/HTTPS firewall configuration

### üíª Development Tools
- Vim text editor
- Rust via rustup
  - bat (a better cat replacement)
  - lsd (a modern ls alternative)
- Python, pip, and virtual environments
- uv - the fast Python package installer
- Node.js and NPM
- PM2 process manager (configured to start on boot)
- pnpm package manager
- Tailwind CSS (global installation)
- shadcn/ui CLI (global installation)

## üìã Prerequisites

- A fresh Ubuntu server installation
- Root or sudo privileges

## üîß Usage

### Option 1: One-Line Command (Recommended)

```bash
# Download and execute in one command
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LurnD/ubuntuscript/main/ubuntu_update.sh)"
```

### Option 2: Download and Run

```bash
# Download the script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LurnD/ubuntuscript/main/ubuntu_update.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x ubuntu_update.sh

# Run the script
sudo ./ubuntu_update.sh
```

### Option 3: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LurnD/ubuntuscript.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd ubuntuscript

# Make the script executable
chmod +x ubuntu_update.sh

# Run the script
sudo ./ubuntu_update.sh
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Zsh Setup**: The script installs Zsh and Oh My Zsh first, making it the default shell. All configurations are added to `.zshrc` only.

2. **SSH Security**: The script configures UFW to allow SSH connections before enabling the firewall to prevent lockout.

3. **Mosh Setup**: Mosh is installed and configured with the necessary UDP ports (60000-61000) opened in the firewall.

4. **DNS Utilities**: The script installs `dnsutils` package which includes tools like `dig` and `nslookup` for network diagnostics.

5. **Fail2Ban Configuration**: A custom Fail2Ban configuration is created to protect against brute force attacks on SSH and Nginx.

6. **Shell Change**: You'll need to log out and log back in for the shell change to Zsh to take effect.

7. **Development Tools**: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui CLI are installed globally, so you can use them in any project with the `tailwindcss` and `shadcn-ui` commands.

8. **Rust Tools**: The script installs `bat` (a better `cat` replacement) and `lsd` (a modern `ls` alternative) with convenient aliases configured in Zsh.

## üîç What the Script Does

1. **Installs Zsh & Oh My Zsh**: Sets up the Zsh shell environment first

2. **Updates System**: Runs `apt update` and `apt upgrade`

3. **Configures SSH & Mosh**: Installs and secures SSH and Mosh for remote access

4. **Installs Network Tools**: Sets up DNS utilities for network diagnostics

5. **Sets Up Firewall**: Configures UFW with SSH and Mosh protection

6. **Installs Nginx**: Sets up a web server with a custom welcome page

7. **Configures Fail2Ban**: Protects against brute force attacks

8. **Installs Rust and Tools**: Sets up Rust via rustup and installs bat and lsd

9. **Installs Python Tools**: Sets up Python, pip, and uv package installer

10. **Installs Node.js Tools**: Sets up Node.js, PM2, pnpm, and global frontend tools

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
